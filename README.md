# SimpleBinaryToDecimalConverterSkeleton
This is basic skeleton code for the optional binary to decimal conversion problem set as problem 2 in the Binary to Decimal worksheet (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ti6u-tpkMMhuQVTkD5sYXAMjnG7cX8MP/view?usp=sharing) for worksheet).
Changes should be made to the BinaryConverter class so that all unit tests pass.
